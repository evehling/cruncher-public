# Cruncher
Welcome to the Cruncher iOS app project page! 👋 I post updates about my Cruncher code, features, and research on this repo. 
> If you're interested in contributing to this project, see [here](https://github.com/evehling/cruncher-public#where-did-your-source-code-go).

## About
🗯 Cruncher is an iOS application that helps you make the most of your free time by identifying free blocks in your schedule, showing you how you spend your time, and helping you schedule tasks and activities at the best possible time. 

🌐 Visit [cruncher.app](https://cruncher.app) for the app landing page and interest form for updates and beta testing.

🧠 Cruncher is designed with neurodiverse individuals particularly in mind by a devloper with ADHD. For more details on how Crunch is designed to work with all different types of brains, see the Wiki.

## FAQ
### Why are you working on this?
I started working on this as a passion project for my personal use after reading [this book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1260143090/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=griff64-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1260143090&linkId=04124a7fad075b228da3d1ff3266ce40) (which is also available for free to read on O'Reilly media with a subscription). As an individual with ADHD, I often feel like there are so many things I want to do but my free time seems to slip through my fingers.

Individuals with ADHD like myself can experience [time blindness](https://chadd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ATTN_10_15_BeatingTimeBlindness.pdf) where it's very difficult to gauge how fast or how much time passes. I've found that creating schedules, routines, and writing tasks into my calendar help immensely but I've found that traditional schedules are too rigid to accomodate my rather chaotic and unpredictable life. 


After reading the above book and practicing the methods Griffith wrote about, I started using a manual (written) system for planning my time but soon found it too rigid and time consuming to do. After researching other mobile apps for scheduling and planning, I couldn't find one that quite satisified my needs so I decided to create my own!

### Where Did Your Source Code Go?
As the size, scope, and interest in this project grew, I decided to split Cruncher into two (well, technically three) public and private repositories. I decided to make most of my source code for Cruncher private (for the time being) for several reasons but still wanted to transparently document the process and techniques for those who are interested. 

I'll post project status, larger issues and features on this public repository. If people are interested in contributing to the source code, please feel free to email me!


### Why do I need this?
You might not need this at all--but for some people like myself (particularly those with ADHD), it can be difficult to identify where your free time *is* and where it's *going*. With the time-sucking nature of social media, hours of our day are often spent on things that don't fulfill our values or our long term goals. 

### Why are you qualified to tell me how to spend my time?
I'm not! Rather, I'm aiming to create something that will help you see *where* you have free time in your schedule and assist with scheduling the things you *want* and *have* to do in the best possible slots. I studied Cognitive Science and Data Science as an undergraduate and am especially passionate about finding the areas our brains fall short in that can be supplemented with technology.

### What is your logo?
The logo for Cruncher is a Cruncher! I wanted to design the Crunchers in a way that made them vaguely anthropomorphic, slightly cute and (above all) clean & simple.

### Yes, the Crunchers Look Like:
  - 🔌 Outlet
  - 🐽 Pig 
  - Other suggestions welcome :-)
